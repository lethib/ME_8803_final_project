    "\n",
    "#### The World Bank\n",
    "The *World Bank* gets its data from different reliable sources and surveys. To compile data, they use the following methodologies:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Consistency**: Data from different sources may have inconsistencies due to differences in timing and reporting practices. The World Bank attempts to present data consistently in terms of definition, timing, and methods in its publications.\n",
    "- **Change in Terminology**: The *World Bank* has adopted new terminology in line with the 1993 System of National Accounts (SNA). This includes changes in the names of economic indicators, such as GNP becoming GNI, GNP per capita becoming GNI per capita, and others.\n",
    "- **Aggregation Rules**: Aggregates in *World Bank* data are based on regional and income classifications of economies. They are approximations of unknown totals or average values due to missing data.\n",
    "- **Growth Rates**: Growth rates are calculated as annual averages and represented as percentages using methods like least squares, exponential endpoint, and geometric endpoint.\n",
    "- **Alternative Conversion Factors**: In cases where official exchange rates are deemed unreliable, alternative conversion factors are used to provide a more accurate representation of currency values for specific countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The International Energy Agency\n",
    "\n",
    "The *International Energy Agency* provides datasets about energy through different sectors (Industry, Residential, Services and Transport). They use administrative sources, measurements and surveys to collect data. A list of all their data collection practices can be fond [here](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-tools/national-data-collection-practices?).\n",

    "#### Our World in Data\n",
    "*Our World in Data* is gathering the most dependable and enlightening data sets related to a specific subject. Their sources are the following ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Specialized institutions, such as the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO).\n",
    "- Research articles.\n",
    "- International organizations and statistical agencies, including the OECD, the World Bank, and UN institutions.\n",
