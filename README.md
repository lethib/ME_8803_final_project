# ME 8803 Final Project

The objective of this project is to assess the suitability of an engineering dataset for machine learning modeling, determine data features that should be used for machine learning, and then fit and critique the performance of ML model(s) using uncertainty quantification.

## Dataset used

The dataset is showcasing sustainable energy indicators and other useful factors across all countries from 2000 to 2020.

It can be obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anshtanwar/global-data-on-sustainable-energy/data).

## Objectives

After some Explanatory Data Analysis (see [EDA](./EDA/)), I have listed 2 possible ojectives for this project from the [`dataset_sampling` notebook](/EDA/dataset_sampling.ipynb):

- Predicting the CO2 emissions
- Predicting the primary energy consumption per capita

Many projects are predicting the CO2 emissions, so I will focus on the second objective. That's why in the modeling part of the project, I will focus on predicting the primary energy consumption per capita.
