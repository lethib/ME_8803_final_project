## 1. How were the data obtained ?

### Data sources

This dataset was obtained from 3 different sources:

- [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/home)
- [International Energy Agency](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-product/world-energy-investment-2021-datafile)
- [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/renewable-energy)

### Data collection

#### The World Bank

The _World Bank_ gets its data from different reliable sources and surveys. To compile data, they use the following methodologies:

- **Data Consistency**: Data from different sources may have inconsistencies due to differences in timing and reporting practices. The World Bank attempts to present data consistently in terms of definition, timing, and methods in its publications.
- **Change in Terminology**: The _World Bank_ has adopted new terminology in line with the 1993 System of National Accounts (SNA). This includes changes in the names of economic indicators, such as GNP becoming GNI, GNP per capita becoming GNI per capita, and others.
- **Aggregation Rules**: Aggregates in _World Bank_ data are based on regional and income classifications of economies. They are approximations of unknown totals or average values due to missing data.
- **Growth Rates**: Growth rates are calculated as annual averages and represented as percentages using methods like least squares, exponential endpoint, and geometric endpoint.
- **Alternative Conversion Factors**: In cases where official exchange rates are deemed unreliable, alternative conversion factors are used to provide a more accurate representation of currency values for specific countries.

#### The International Energy Agency

The _International Energy Agency_ provides datasets about energy through different sectors (Industry, Residential, Services and Transport). They use administrative sources, measurements and surveys to collect data. A list of all their data collection practices can be fond [here](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-tools/national-data-collection-practices?).

#### Our World in Data

_Our World in Data_ is gathering the most dependable and enlightening data sets related to a specific subject. Their sources are the following ones:

- Specialized institutions, such as the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO).
- Research articles.
- International organizations and statistical agencies, including the OECD, the World Bank, and UN institutions.
- Official data obtained from government sources.

This dataset mainle containes Time Series data. Most of the features are measurements taken at different points in time (each year), grouped by country. The only exception is the `Entity` feature, which is a categorical feature. We can also pinpoint that the `Density` feature has a weird data type: `object`. Usually, a density muste be given as a number (a int or a float). Let's take a look at the values of this feature.

```python
df['Density\\n(P/Km2)'].unique()
```

    array(['60', '105', '18', '26', '223', '17', '104', '590', '3', '109',

           '75', '118', '281', '36', '79', '38'], dtype=object)

The `Density` feature contains numbers represented as strings. This will be a problem for our analysis and modeling. We will have to convert this feature to a numeric type.

We can separate the features into 3 categories:

- Potential factors: these features are independant variables.
- Cofactors: these features are variables that may influence the response variable.
- Response: these features are the ones we might want to predict.

Depending on the question we want to answer, we will use different features. For example, if we want to predict the carbon emissions of a country, we will use the `Value_co2_emissions_kt_by_country` feature as the response variable and the `Electricity from fossil fuels (TWh)` feature as a cofactor. If we want to classify the access to renewable energy, the `Access to clean fuels for cooking` feature will be the response variable and the `Renewable energy share in the total final energy consumption (%)` feature will be a cofactor.

So, it is quite a bit hard to say which features are potential factors, cofactors or response variables. We can still make a table like this one:

| Features                                                         | Potential Factors | Cofactors | Response |

## 4. Overall data dimension

```python
df.shape
```

    (3649, 21)

The dataset contains 3649 entries for 21 features !

## 5. Missing values

Let's take a look at the missing values in our dataset. We will use `seaborn` to plot those missing values.

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(20,10))
sns.heatmap(df.isnull(), cbar=False)
plt.ylabel('index', fontweight='bold', fontsize=12)
plt.xlabel('features', fontweight='bold', fontsize=12)
plt.title('Missing values for each feature in the dataset', fontweight='bold', fontsize=15)
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/dataset_description_19_1.png" />
</p>

We can clearly see that some features are densed and other are sparsed. Heavily sparsed features (features that we might drop) are the following ones:

- Renewable-electricity-generating-capacity-per-capita
- Financial flows to developing countries (US $)
- Value_co2_emissions_kt_by_country
- Renewables (% equivalent primary energy)

Let's not forget that the entries of the dataset can easily be grouped by countries. We can guess that those thin lines of missing values that we see in the figure might correspond to some years where we don't have data. Thick block of missing values could mean that the country doesn't have any data for this feature.

The `groupby.count()` pandas' method compute count of group, excluding missing values. We know that the dataset is providing 21 years of data for each country. So, we can use this method to check if we have missing values for some countries.

```python
df_count_values_by_country = df.groupby('Entity').count()
df_count_values_by_country.shape
```

    (176, 20)

```python
fig = plt.figure(layout='constrained', figsize=(20, 30))
axs = fig.subplot_mosaic("""A;B;C;D""")

sns.heatmap(df_count_values_by_country.iloc[:44].T, xticklabels=True, yticklabels=True, ax=axs['A'])
sns.heatmap(df_count_values_by_country.iloc[44:88].T, xticklabels=True, yticklabels=True, ax=axs['B'])
sns.heatmap(df_count_values_by_country.iloc[88:132].T, xticklabels=True, yticklabels=True, ax=axs['C'])
sns.heatmap(df_count_values_by_country.iloc[132:].T, xticklabels=True, yticklabels=True, ax=axs['D'])

fig.suptitle('Number of values for each feature in the dataset by country', fontweight='bold', fontsize=15)
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/dataset_description_23_1.png" />
</p>

We can pinpoint some countries that gave a lot of missing values for all the features:

- French Guiana
- Montenegro
- Serbia
- South Sudan

We also have features that have the same amount of missing values across all the countries. This would mean that those data were not collected for a specific range of years. The features that have this behavior are the following ones:

- Renewable energy share in the total final energy consumption
- Energy intensity level of primary energy (MJ/$2017 PPP GDP)
- Value_co2_emissions_kt_by_country

Features that are not heavily sparsed might be imputed in the process of modeling:

- Access to clean fuels for cooking
- Electricity from nuclear (TWh)
- Electricity from renewables (TWh)
- Low-carbon electricity (% electricity)
- GDP growth
- GDP per capita
