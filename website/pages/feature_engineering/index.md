## 1. Supervised or Unsupervised Learning?

As discussed in the [next_steps section](../EDA/next_steps.md), the goal of this project is to predict the **Primary Energy consumption per Capita** using regression algorithms. Regressions algorithm are supervised Machine Learning algorithms.

Inputs and outputs features have already been determined :

| Features                                                         | Factor | Cofactor | Response |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | :----: | :------: | :------: |
| Access to electricity (% of population)                          |   X    |    X     |          |
| Access to clean fuels for cooking                                |   X    |    X     |          |
| Renewable energy share in the total final energy consumption (%) |   X    |    X     |          |
| Primary energy consumption per capita (kWh/person)               |        |          |    X     |
| GDP per capita                                                   |   X    |    X     |          |

## 2. Features Details

Based on the Exploratory Data Analysis, I have saved 3 different datasets to train my regression models:

1. [`pe_dataset.csv`](https://github.com/lethib/PE_Consumption/blob/main/data/pe/pe_dataset.csv): This dataset contains all the rows of the main dataset but has only targetted features (inputs and outputs + country name and year).
2. [`normalized_pe_dataset.csv`](https://github.com/lethib/PE_Consumption/blob/main/data/pe/normalized_pe_dataset.csv): Same as `pe_dataset.csv` but with normalized numerical features.
3. [`normalized_pe_dataset_without_outliers.csv`](https://github.com/lethib/PE_Consumption/blob/main/data/pe/normalized_pe_dataset_without_outliers.csv): Same as `normalized_pe_dataset.csv` but without top outliers.

It will be interesting to **watch how the models perform on each dataset**. Data features were not collected from experiments or simulations but based on administratives sources, measurements and surveys. More details about that in the [dataset description section](../EDA/dataset_description.md/#1-how-were-the-data-obtained).

**No Machine Learning models, no data augmentation and PCA have been used to derive the features**. Daata features are the raw values from the main dataset that has only been normalized for the second and third datasets.

## 3. Features types

As discussed in the [datset sampling section](../EDA/dataset_sampling.md/#2-feature-selection), all of the features (inputs and outputs) are modeled as continuous distributions (I don't take into account the country name and the year which are not relevant). Moreover, all of the features are numerical.

## 4. Data Cleaning

```python
df_pe = pd.read_csv("../data/pe/pe_dataset.csv")
df_pe.info()
```

**As the dataset is devided by countries, doing a hot deck imputation directly on all the dataset would be a mistake**. For instance, data for _France_ and for _Yemen_ are not comparable. In one hand we have a developed country and in the other hand we have a developing country. Therefore, it is better to **do a hot deck imputation for each country separately**.

Due to the fact that we don't have a huge amount of missing values that will be imputed, **I have decided to use an interpolation startegy for each country** (it might not change a lot the distribution).

```python
countries = df_pe['Entity'].unique()
```

```python
# Interpolate missing values for each country
for country in countries:
    df_pe[df_pe['Entity'] == country] = df_pe[df_pe['Entity'] == country].interpolate(method='linear', limit_direction='forward', axis=0)
```

For other missing values, we will drop the rows that contain them. After this step, **we still have more than 3,000 rows** which is enough to train our models.

```python
df_pe = df_pe.dropna(axis=0)
df_pe.to_csv("../data/pe/cleaned/pe_dataset.csv", index=False)
df_pe.info()
```

We will do the same cleaning process for the two remaining datasets !

```python
def clean_data(df, countries):
    for country in countries:
        df[df['Entity'] == country] = df[df['Entity'] == country].interpolate(method='linear', limit_direction='forward', axis=0)
    return df.dropna(axis=0)
```

```python
normalized_df_pe = pd.read_csv("../data/pe/normalized_pe_dataset.csv")
normalized_df_pe = clean_data(normalized_df_pe, countries)
normalized_df_pe.to_csv("../data/pe/cleaned/normalized_pe_dataset.csv", index=False)
normalized_df_pe.info()
```

Saving those DataFrames into CSV files will allow us to use them in the next notebooks to train our models.
