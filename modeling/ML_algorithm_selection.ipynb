    "All of the models do not have a huge number of parameters. As our feature are highly correlated (meaning that a strong linear relationship exits between the input and the output), I think that the Linear Regression algorithm will be the best one as it is the simplest one. However, Elastic Net and Linear SVR can be good alternatives as they can be more robust to outliers (linear regression can easily lead to overfitting). They also are not that complicated to understand and tune. It would be interesting to compare the results of the 3 algorithms."
